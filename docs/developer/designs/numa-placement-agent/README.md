# Per-Node NUMA Placement Agent

## Summary

An optional per-node DaemonSet that reads the kubelet's **podresources API**, derives the
actual NUMA-node placement of each pod's exclusive resources (GPUs, CPUs, NICs, memory), and
publishes that attribution back onto the pod (as an annotation). When the agent is deployed,
the [NUMA scheduler plugin](../numa-topology/README.md) consumes this *observed* placement
instead of *predicting* it — making its per-zone accounting, and in particular its
reclaim/preemption simulation, accurate.

This agent is **part of the NUMA plugin v1**, and the scheduler is built to consume its input from
day one — but **deploying it is optional**: the plugin works without it on a predicted-placement
fallback, so the agent is an accuracy upgrade rather than a hard dependency (the KAI operator
deploys it automatically when the `numa` plugin is enabled). It is also a deliberate **stopgap for
the device-plugin + Topology Manager world** — under Dynamic Resource Allocation the scheduler
already knows real placement (see *Superseded long-term by DRA*) — and the capability it provides
is being built upstream (see *Prior art*).

## Motivation

The `NodeResourceTopology` (NRT) CRD the scheduler consumes is **aggregate per zone** — it
reports "zone 0 has 2 free GPUs," never "pod V holds a GPU in zone 0." But the kubelet's
Topology Manager makes the real per-pod NUMA assignment at admission, and the scheduler never
observes it. The NUMA plugin therefore *predicts* each pod's zone.

Prediction is adequate for filtering (the kubelet backstops admission), but it is a genuine
problem for **reclaim simulation**: to free an aligned slot for a pending pod, the scheduler
must know which zone evicting a victim opens up. If it mispredicts the victim's zone, it can
evict a victim that does *not* create a usable aligned slot — a wasted eviction plus a
`TopologyAffinityError` bounce. (This bites specifically when the pending pod needs multiple
per-zone-scarce resources co-located; GPU-bound pods with abundant per-zone CPU are largely
immune — see the plugin doc's *Reclaim-simulation accuracy* note.)

The information the scheduler is missing exists on the node: the kubelet podresources API
reports, per container, the exact device IDs (with their NUMA `Topology`) and CPU IDs that were
allocated. Surfacing it removes the prediction entirely.

## Goals

- Publish, per pod, the actual NUMA-node assignment of its topology-aligned resources.
- Let the NUMA scheduler plugin consume observed placement when available, and fall back to
  prediction when not — so the agent is purely additive.
- Keep the scheduler's consumption cheap (no new informer, no new CRD if avoidable).

## Non-Goals

- Replacing the NRT exporter. NRT (aggregate per-zone availability) is still required; this
  agent is complementary (per-pod attribution).
- Influencing the kubelet's placement. The agent is read-only with respect to allocation; it
  observes and reports, it does not hint or pin.
- Supporting pods the kubelet does not NUMA-align (non-Guaranteed). Those have no exclusive
  placement to report.

## Design Details

### Architecture

A DaemonSet on each NUMA/GPU node. Each instance:

1. Connects to the local kubelet podresources gRPC socket
   (`/var/lib/kubelet/pod-resources/kubelet.sock`, hostPath-mounted, read-only).
2. Calls `List` (and watches, where supported) to get per-pod, per-container resource
   allocations: device IDs with `Topology.Nodes` (NUMA affinity), `cpu_ids`, and memory blocks
   with their NUMA node.
3. Maps each allocation to a NUMA node:
   - **Devices** (GPU/NIC): the NUMA node is in the podresources `Topology` field directly.
   - **CPUs**: map `cpu_ids` → NUMA node using the node's CPU topology (from `/sys` or the NRT
     zones already on the node).
   - **Memory**: the podresources memory blocks carry their NUMA node.
4. Writes the result onto the pod as an annotation (only for pods holding aligned resources,
   only when the value changes).

### Published format

A single annotation on the pod, resource → {NUMA node → quantity}:

```
kai.scheduler/numa-placement-observed: |
  {"nvidia.com/gpu":{"0":2},"cpu":{"0":8},"memory":{"0":17179869184}}
```

The `-observed` suffix distinguishes this agent's *measured* placement from the scheduler's own
`kai.scheduler/numa-placement-predicted` record (see the plugin design); both share the same
value format.

This represents multi-zone placement too (a `restricted`/multi-NUMA pod would list more than
one node), so it is not specific to `single-numa-node`.

### Scheduler consumption

The NUMA plugin, when building its per-zone model:

Precedence is **observed > predicted > re-derive**:

- **If a pod carries `kai.scheduler/numa-placement-observed`** → use the observed per-zone
  quantities directly; this **supersedes** any scheduler-predicted record. Occupancy is now
  *exact*, not predicted: per-zone availability can be reconstructed as
  `capacity[zone] − Σ observed_placement[zone]`, and a victim's eviction credits the *real* zone.
  Reclaim simulation becomes accurate.
- **Else if the pod carries the scheduler's `…-predicted` record** → use that (stable, but a
  prediction — see the plugin design).
- **Else** (agent absent, pod not yet observed, non-aligned, and no predicted record) → re-derive
  via the evaluator.

When both records are present, their agreement is the prediction-accuracy signal described in
the plugin design.

No new informer or CRD is needed — the scheduler already watches pods, so the annotation rides
the existing pod cache.

### Lifecycle and freshness

Placement is **stable**: the kubelet pins a pod's exclusive resources for the pod's lifetime,
so once written the annotation does not change until the pod ends. The agent therefore writes
once per pod (shortly after the pod starts running) and on the rare re-allocation. There is a
small initial lag between a pod starting and the annotation appearing — during that window the
plugin falls back to prediction for that pod, exactly as if the agent were absent.

### RBAC and security

- **Agent → kubelet podresources:** read-only access to the podresources socket via a hostPath
  mount. This is the same surface NRT exporters use.
- **Agent → API server:** `patch` on pods (annotations only). Scoped to the annotation key.
- **Scheduler:** no new permissions — it already lists/watches pods.

## Interaction with the NUMA plugin and NRT

- **NRT** remains the source for aggregate per-zone *availability* and Topology Manager
  policy/scope.
- **This agent** supplies per-pod *attribution*, which the plugin layers on top to turn
  predicted occupancy into observed occupancy.
- With the agent present, the plugin's prediction-based reconstruction (and its drift/accuracy
  caveats) is bypassed for annotated pods; the fingerprint freshness signal is still useful for
  the aggregate `Available` numbers but is no longer load-bearing for reclaim accuracy.

## Limitations and Caveats

- **Initial-observation lag:** a just-started pod is unannotated until the agent observes it;
  the plugin falls back to prediction meanwhile.
- **Agent must be deployed on every relevant node**, or coverage is partial (mixed
  observed/predicted placement — still correct, just less accurate on un-covered nodes).
- **Annotation write load:** bounded by writing only for aligned pods and only on change;
  placement stability keeps this to roughly one write per pod lifetime.

## Prior art and relationship to upstream

This is a **known pattern**, not a novel mechanism — the gap it fills is well-documented and
others are actively building the same capability:

- **The gap is documented upstream.** The scheduler-plugins NRT design ([KEP-119][kep119]) states
  that only the kubelet's Topology Manager knows a pod's exact NUMA node and the scheduler learns
  it "with latency"; that is exactly why the NRT plugin uses a pessimistic *overreserve* cache
  reconciled by the [pod fingerprint](../numa-topology/README.md#appendix-a-optional-cross-cycle-staleness-compensation).
- **Direct analog, in progress.** The topology-aware WG is building per-container NUMA-placement
  feedback from the same podresources data: the [`numaplacement`][numaplacement] encoding and
  resource-topology-exporter PRs ([#390][rte390]/#396) derive each container's actual NUMA
  affinity and publish it — but as **NRT CRD node-level attributes** (alongside the fingerprint),
  *not* as pod annotations.
- **Abandoned alternative.** A podresources `Watch`/streaming endpoint ([KEP-1926][kep1926]) was
  proposed partly to feed exactly this kind of monitor/exporter, but was never implemented.
- **Volcano** has the identical limitation: its `numa-aware` plugin only *predicts* placement
  (`assignRes`) and pushes the prediction back; it does not read actual placement from a node
  agent.

**Transport choice — the one real differentiator.** This design annotates the **individual pod**
(`kai.scheduler/numa-placement`) rather than encoding placement into the per-node NRT object. A
pod annotation is simpler for a scheduler to consume per-pod, but it has write-amplification and
object-ownership downsides that the single-NRT-object approach avoids. **Recommendation:** prefer
**consuming the upstream NRT placement attribute** (`numaplacement` / RTE) once it lands, and
treat this DaemonSet-annotates-pods variant as the fallback for clusters that need it sooner. The
scheduler-side consumption (observed-over-predicted) is identical either way.

## Superseded long-term by DRA

Under **Dynamic Resource Allocation** ([KEP-3063][kep3063], GA-track) the scheduler itself
allocates devices and records them in `ResourceClaim` status, and DRA drivers can expose NUMA
node as a device attribute — so the scheduler knows real placement with no scraping. This agent
is therefore a stopgap for the legacy device-plugin + Topology Manager world (and for CPU/memory
NUMA, which DRA does not yet manage — [KEP-3695][kep3695] tracks bridging podresources/DRA). As
workloads move to DRA, the need for it fades.

## Future Work

- Consume the upstream `numaplacement` NRT attribute (RTE) instead of self-published pod
  annotations, once available.
- Use observed placement for NUMA *scoring*, not just feasibility/reclaim.
- Revisit/retire as workloads migrate to DRA.
